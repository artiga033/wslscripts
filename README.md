# WSL Scripts
Here are collections of some scripts(both Windows and Linux side)
that is useful when working with WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) version 2.

They are generally designed for my self-use. But by just taking a look
at the comments you may figure it out quickly.

## List

| Name                                        | Description                                                                                                                             |

| [mount-external-vhd](./mount-external-vhd/) | Attach an external VHD/VHDX to the WSL instance on boot and mount it (e.g., as your home directory). Requires systemd.                 |
| [ssh-agent-replay](./ssh-agent-replay/)     | Relay the Windows ssh-agent into WSL using npiperelay and socat. Requires systemd.                                                      |
